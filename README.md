# 🔬 PCOs Detection & Support System Using Deep Learning 

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) from ultrasound images. The model has been trained to identify characteristic patterns associated with PCOS, providing a preliminary screening tool for healthcare professionals.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Our CNN model architecture is specifically optimized for analyzing ultrasound imagery:
- Input Layer: Accepts grayscale ultrasound images
- Multiple Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction
- Pooling Layers: For dimensional reduction
- Dense Layers: For final classification
- Output: Binary classification (PCOS positive/negative)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Dataset Preparation
1. Download the training and testing datasets
2. Compress them into zip files:
3. Upload these zip files to your Google Colab environment

### Running the Model
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Mount your Google Drive
3. Upload the zipped datasets
4. Execute all cells sequentially
